  On 28 September 2015, Grealish confirmed that he had decided to represent England at international level.[74] He made his debut for England under-21s on 19 May 2016 as a 72nd-minute substitute for Ruben Loftus-Cheek in a 1–0 win over Portugal at the Toulon Tournament.[75] On his first start four days later he scored twice in the first half of a 7–1 win over Guinea.[76] England went on to win the tournament for the first time since 1994.[77] Grealish was named in the squad for England under-21 at the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship.[78] From 2016 to 2017, he made seven appearances for the under-21s, scoring two goals.[79]
  On 31 August 2020, for the first time, Grealish was called up to the senior England squad for the UEFA Nations League fixtures against Iceland and Denmark.[80] On 8 September, he made his senior debut as a 76th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw against Denmark.[81]
  On 1 June 2021, Grealish was named in the 26-man squad for the newly rescheduled UEFA Euro 2020.[82] On 29 June, in the Round of 16 match against Germany, Grealish was introduced as a substitute in the 68th minute and contributed directly to both goals in a 2–0 win, playing in Luke Shaw to assist Raheem Sterling, and crossing for Harry Kane to head in late in the match.[83]
