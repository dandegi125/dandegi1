  <p>
    Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,<br>
    kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football<br>
    that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football<br>
    include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); <br>
    gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football;<br>
    rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football.[1]<br>
    These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
